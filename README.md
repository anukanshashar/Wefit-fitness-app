 ## -> Project Inspiration
 
  - Fitness and good health has been under the radar since a few years from now, especially since the outbreak of Covid-19. People were forced to stay inside of their homes and all activities and processes were carried out online. This had a huge impact on fitness levels of people, with increased rate of chronic diseases and other problems (both physical as well as mental) such as heart attack, cancer, depression, anxiety, dementia etc. According to te GOQii India Fit Report, only 38% Indians come under the umbrella of "fit" citizens, with women being unhealthier than men and having a worse BMI.
  - The We-Fit fitness app is an all-in-one assistant which provides many features and options to promote physical as well as mental well-being. The app offers stretching exercises, meditation, yoga, food and water intake, personalized training routine etc; focusing on all aspects of health and fitness in a friendly and efficient manner. 
 
 ## -> Project Description
 
  - This mobile application is developed with the aim to promote physical and mental well-being by incorporating various activities, exercises and suggestions on food    items and calorie intake. The training routines target people from all age groups, including yoga positions and stretching exercises. The app mainly focuses on women health as many exercises are primarily included for women.
  - All exercises have an inclusive timer along with a motivational quote which displays prior to commencement for enlightenment and motivation of the user. This app is near perfect for someone who wants to be fit in all facets, without having to leave their home. No additional apparatus/machinery is required for any of the exercises.
  - We keep mental health in mind by introducing the meditations section with audios and timers for a soothing and relaxing experience.  
  - The diet section provides a detailed description of food items to be consumed along with their calorie count, which is a function of the users physical parameters such as weight, BMI, etc.
